### File Module

The file module is used for manipulating all things file related.
Hence the name.

It can be used to create, delete and modify file properties.

The copy module may be used to copy files from a number of sources:

1.  The Control node to target nodes
2.  The files systems on the target node
3.  Created during the exec of the copy module and placed on target nodes

Theres not much complexity around this module, so its best to just look at the ansible documentation to find more information around this.
